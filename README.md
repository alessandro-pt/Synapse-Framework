# What is Synapse

Synapse is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop web apps and websites much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. Synapse lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.
